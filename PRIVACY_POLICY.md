# Privacy Policy

Last updated: [Current Date]

This privacy policy applies to the "SC Audio Archiver" browser extension (the "Extension").

## 1. No Data Collection

We do not collect, store, use, or share any personal information or any other user data. The Extension operates entirely on the user's local machine.

## 2. Permissions

The Extension requires the following permissions to function:

*   **Access to `soundcloud.com`**: This is necessary to inject the download button into the user interface and to make API calls to retrieve public track information.
*   **`downloads`**: This permission is required to save the downloaded audio files to the user's computer.

No data related to these permissions is ever transmitted to the developer or any third party.

## 3. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us through our GitHub repository.
